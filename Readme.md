# Pitch
## musical game prototype for autistic children

“Pitch” is the results of a project developed at Drake Music, the charity leader in music, disability and technology. DM believes music should be accessible to everyone despite their mental or physical conditions. Their works range from art making to learning. They focus on the ability and the needs of the person rather than their physical impairments. This opens up to new, unexpected possibilities.

The aim of this project is to prototype an interactive system for autistic children which could facilitate their approach to simple elements of music. This system has been thought as a game which engages the children in pitch recognition and memory, stimulating critical features of their abilities such as social skills and motor coordination.

## installation details
The game has been built using OpenFrameworks 098 www.openframeworks.cc. It has been tested on OS 10.9.5 mvericks and Sierra.
No addons are needed so, it should compile and run very easily.
Just clone the repository in the app folder of your OF root and it should be ready to go.
Check on my page if you need an Android version or a RPi version.
Both run on OF 098. They are slightly different but the logic of the game is the same.

## Rules
You will hear a sequence of notes and you will have to press the buttons according to what's your perception of the pitch.
The game can be played alone but it has been designed as a collaborative game to engage the children in imitation, social skills and motor coordination

## Bugs and notes
No bugs are present at the moment. The RPi Version has an audio glitch in the initial stage and this needs to be investigated. The rest should wor without any issue. Please feel free to report any comments.

The system will save a log file for each round played. The log file saves the music instrument used, the level of difficulty, the number of notes in the main sequence and other stats that can be useful for research and for tutors.
